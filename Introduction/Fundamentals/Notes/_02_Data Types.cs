/*
 * VALUE DATA TYPE: 
 * 
 *      INTEGER: 
 *      Value Data Type will directly store the variable value in memory.
 *      int-16 bit, int 32 bit, long 64 bit etc.
 *      
 *      FLOATING POINT: 
 *          Float: 
 *              32bit single precision, use F at the end, otherwise, it will be treated as double.
 *          Double: 
 *              64bit double precision, use d at the end, but not mandatory.
 *              
 *     DECIMAL: 
 *          128 bit data type for monetary calculations. Use M at the end.
 *          decimal d  = <number>.
 *          
 *     CHARACTER: 
 *          16 bit unicode character.
 *          
 * REFERENCE DATA TYPES: 
 *      These will store memory address and not the actual value, because actual value will live under heap.
 *      Stored memory address (var) will be stored in stack.
 *      
 *      String And Objects are the prominent examples.
 *      
 *      
 *      
 * POINTER DATA TYPES:  
 *      These will store the memory addresses.
 *      & is called the address operator.
 *      * is called Indirection operator.
