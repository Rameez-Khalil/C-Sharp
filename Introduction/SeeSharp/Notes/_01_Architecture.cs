/*
 * DOT NET FRAMEWORK: 
 *  It acts as a runtime environment for our application, and it suppors multiple language not just C#.
 *  
 *  DOT NET COMPONENT: 
 *      CLR - Common Language Runtime: 
 *          Responsible for managing the execution of code written in any of the .NET-supported language.
 *          CLR loads the libraries and compiles the code into a machine readable format.
 *          Automatic memory management and security are managed by default.
 *     
 *     FCL - Framework Class Library: 
 *          It provides large set of pre-built functions and classes.
 *          It provides various namespaces which contains classes that provide features like IO/N/W etc.
 *     
 *     CIL - Common Intermediate Language: 
 *          This acts as a middleware between the code gets pulled by CLR.
 *          This is responsible for converting the source code into an IL code.
 *     
 *     JIT Compiler - Just In Time Compiler.
 *          This part of the CLR is responsible for converting the IL code which lives in the assemblies into 
 *          machine readable code.
 *          
 *     ASSEMBLIES: 
 *          When we compile a C# program, the compiler generates an assembly from the source code.
 *          This assembly contains the IL code.
 *          This assembly acts as a container to the types, methods, props and other information about the code.
 *          
 *          
 *          EXECUTABLE ASSEMBLY - .exe
 *          Class Library Assembly - .dll.
 *          
 *          
 *
