/*
 * INHERITANCE: 
 *      Inheritance is all about creating a new class based off of an existing class.
 *      Private members and Static constructors do not get rolled over onto the child class.
 *      
 * TYPES: 
 *      1. SINGLE LEVEL: 
 *              A class that inherits from one base class
 *              
 *      2. MULTI LEVEL: 
 *              A class that inherits from a class which is an extension of another class.
 *              C inherits B and B inherits A.
 *              
 *      3. Hierarchical:
 *              A class serving as a parent for two or more derived class.
 *              A is the parent class, then B inherits A and C also inherits A.
 *              
 *      4. Multiple and Hybrid aren't allowed due to ambiguity error.
 *
