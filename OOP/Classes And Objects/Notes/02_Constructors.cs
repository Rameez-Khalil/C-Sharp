/*
 * CONSTRUCTORS: 
 *      A special function that automatically gets invoked as soon as the object gets called for initialization.
 *      Like other methods, constructors also have some actions to perform.
 *      
 *      CONSTRUCTORS CONSTRAINTS: 
 *              Cannot be used with keywords such as: abstract, final and syncrhonized.
 *              Only one static constructor is allowed within the same class.
 *              Static constructors cannot be parametrized.
 *              
 *     TYPES OF CONSTRUCTORS: 
 *              1. Default Constructor: 
 *                      Sets the default values for fields, integral types get set to 0 and objects/strings are set to null.
 *              2. Parameterized Constructor: 
 *                      At least one parameter is applied.
 *                      
 *              3. Copy Constructor: 
 *                      This constructor creates an object by copying variables from another object.
 *                      Its main purpose is to initialize a new instance to the values of an existing instance.
 *                      
 *              4. Private Constructor: 
 *                      If a constructor is private, then the other classes or the class itself cannot create object of the class where private constructor has been defined.
 *                      
 *              5. Static Constructor: 
 *                      Static constructor is a special type of constructor that is used to initialize any static members of a class, before the class is used or any static methods are called.
 *                      
 *                      
 *
